    option: "1. Authenticated",
    body: `Congratulations! Your ecobrick has been authenticated and is now ready to build with.

For ideas on using your Ecobricks in a project or advice on building methods please visit our website www.ecobricks.org

Thank you for your amazing effort and care for our biosphere. Each ecobrick is given a star rating so you might find that yours has been included in our monthly top ten gallery as featured on our website and on Gobrik.

We look forward to authenticating your next brick.`

  {
    option: "2. No serial number",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick, we can see that it is well made, so it is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because the photo you submitted does not meet the criteria as described on Step 2 of the logging form.

Each ecobrick record has its own unique serial number. The serial should be inscribed directly onto the wall of the bottle using one of the permanent methods described on the form. This ensures that all the relevant data (where, when and by whom the brick was made) stay with the brick throughout the decades and centuries to come! The more information we can leave future generations, the richer our gift.

To read more about how to inscribe your ecobrick, please look at step 9 of our 10 step guide at https://ecobricks.org/en/how.php

If you would like your ecobrick to be authenticated, please log it again under a new serial number, following the inscription advice and ensuring all the photo criteria have been met.

We look forward to reviewing your amended entry.`

    option: "3. There are labels on the ecobrick",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick! We can see that it is well made so it is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because the photo you submitted does not meet the criteria as described on Step 2 of the logging form.

We ask that you remove any product labels and refrain from using external labels to inscribe the serial number and weight. Any external label will quickly degrade, fall off and shed microplastics (from the label or the adhesive) into the biosphere. Original labels are far better inside the bottle! Also, if you have inscribed the serial number on a label this information will be lost when the label falls off.

    option: "4. The cap is missing or cannot be seen",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick! We can see that it is well made so it is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because the photo you submitted does not meet the criteria as described on page 2 of the logging form.

We need to check that your ecobrick is not packed to overflowing, that the cap fits securely and is not damaged. It is important to ensure that the plastic you have sequestered will be protected from the elements.

To read more about why this is important, please look at step 8 of our 10 step guide at https://ecobricks.org/en/how.php

    option: "5. Wrong type of cap",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick. We can see that it is well made so it is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because the type of bottle you have chosen has a flip open or sports type cap. These have proven to break easily in a build, exposing the contents to the elements which starts the degradation process and ultimately affects the stability of the ecobrick.

You may be able to find a suitable screw top cap to replace this one, if not then sadly you will have to repack the plastic in a new container.`

  {
    option: "6. Parts of the ecobrick are covered or cropped out",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick. We hope you enjoyed the process. It is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because the photo you submitted does not meet the criteria as described on Step 2 of the logging form.

In order to be authenticated your brick must undergo a visual safety check by our validator community. As we cannot hold the brick in our own hands, it is vital your photo shows us that it is safe to build with. To do this we need to check that it is evenly packed with no squishy bits, that the contents are clean and dry, that it is safely sealed by its cap, that the base is not damaged and that it carries its unique serial number written on its walls using a permanent method.

Since we cannot see your full ecobrick, we cannot confirm all of these criteria. ðŸ˜ž

    option: "7. The ecobrick is too small to be reviewed",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick. We hope you enjoyed the process. It is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because the photo you submitted does not allow us to accurately review your ecobrick.

Whilst we love to see photos of our ecobrickers, we ask you to upload them using the selfie option as a secondary image. The basic ecobrick photo should have the ecobrick as its main focus.

    option: "10. There is paper or other non plastic materials in the contents",
    body: `Thank you for your interest in ecobricking and for wanting to sequester your plastic waste. Unfortunately your brick has been rejected because it does not comply with our criteria. Ecobricks are PET bottles filled with clean, dry plastic waste. Other materials such as paper do not need to be sequestered as they are biodegradable or can be infinitely recycled such as aluminium or glass. Please read step 4 of our 10 step guide to ecobricking https://ecobricks.org/en/how.php or the wikipedia entry on ecobricks.

    option: "11. The contents do not look clean/ dry",
    body: `Thank you for your interest in ecobricking and for wanting to sequester your plastic waste. Unfortunately your brick has been rejected because we are concerned about the contents of your bottle.

Dirty plastic inside an ecobrick will lead to microbiological growth and methane forming inside your ecobrick (for a solution for dirty plastic see the Ocean Ecobrick https://ecobricks.org/en/ocean.php). Since ecobricks are often used to make home furniture you also want to avoid unsightly ecobricks, bloated bottles and in rare cases, caps popping off.

It is likewise important that the plastic is dry! Wet and moist plastic will also encourage microbial growth. Ecobrikers around the world use different methods for drying their washed plasticâ€“ from laundry machines to cloths lines.

    option: "12. The ecobrick looks squishy",
    body: `Thank you for your interest in ecobricking and for wanting to sequester your plastic waste. Unfortunately your brick has been rejected because we are concerned about the contents of your bottle.

When you log your brick it undergoes a density check based on the information you have provided. If you have made an error in the volume or weight of your brick this can result in a false density calculation.

In rare cases such as this ecobricks can scrape through the density requirements but still be a cause for concern.

Ecobricks that are below 0.33 g/ml are too squishy to be used for modules and are not ideal for earth building. Soft ecobricks can compromise structural constructions and will dent easily, which reduces their lifespan. Low-density ecobricks are also fire hazards because of the air pockets remaining inside them. See: https://ecobricks.org/fire

    option: "13. Wrong weight or volume",
    body: `Thank you for making this ecobrick we can see that it is well made so it is with regret that Iâ€™m writing to you to explain that your entry has been rejected. This is because you have made errors in the data on your logging form. Either you have entered the incorrect volume for your bottle ( ie how much liquid it held) or the weight you have logged does not match the weight we can see on the scales or written on the bottle.

When you log your brick it undergoes a density check based on the information you have provided. If you have made an error in the volume or weight of your brick this can result in a false density calculation.

If you would like your ecobrick to be authenticated, please log it again under a new serial number ensuring that the information you provide this time is correct

  {
    option: "14. Too big a gap at the top.",
    body: `Thank you for your interest in ecobricking and for wanting to sequester your plastic waste. Unfortunately your brick has been rejected because there is too big a gap at the top of your bottle which will make this part of the brick unstable.

Whilst we do recommend leaving a gap of 1 or 2 cm at the top of your bottle to allow for expansion of the contents, this measurement is from the rim of the bottle. In practice this is usually the thick part where the screw thread is located and often totally covered by the cap. Please can you add a little more plastic to your brick?

If you would like your ecobrick to be authenticated, please log it again under a new serial number ensuring that the new weight is entered.

We look forward to seeing your improved ecobricks.`
