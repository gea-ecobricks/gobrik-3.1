How we write the name of our home planet unconsciously encodes the relation=
ship we have with it


Today, as we become more and more aware of the ecological crises that beset=
 our planet, many of us are moved to take action. Frankly, it's pretty insp=
iring. Over the last two decades, as we've all come to observe and experien=
ce the effects of our modern industrialized economies, environmental care h=
as become a defining concern. Green is not only cool=E2=80=94it's the color=
 of the new generation. Ecological integration is not just a trend; it's a =
civilizational shift. And planetary thinking isn't just for astronauts=E2=
=80=94 it=E2=80=99s for all of us.

However, in the vast task of correcting and regenerating modern depletions,=
 it's easy to get caught up in superficial actions rather than the fundamen=
tal shift our age requires.

Forget about recycling, gardening, or permaculture projects.

I don't care how many trees you're going to plant or how many tons of CO=E2=
=82=82 you want to offset.

There's really only one place to start.

With our words.

In particular, the very word for our planet that we so long to love.

Long ago, Plato pointed out, "The corruption of the City begins with the co=
rruption of words." More poignantly, Albert Camus wrote, "Mal nommer un obj=
et, c=E2=80=99est ajouter au malheur du monde"=E2=80=94"To misname an objec=
t is to add to the misfortune of the world"=C2=B9.

What were they getting at?

They observed that the more our words and their meanings diverge from the r=
eality they represent, the more society suffers. Indeed, our words=E2=80=94=
the tiny building blocks of sentences, paragraphs, stories, and visions=E2=
=80=94if corrupted, can manifest cities and worlds of great woe.

While Plato and Camus had societal woe in mind, as we know too well today, =
there=E2=80=99s also the ecological sort: pollution, ecological degradation=
, and biological depletion.

For the last ten years, my colleague Banayan and I have been reflecting on =
this kind of woe and where it comes from. We've been working hard on plasti=
c pollution from the perspective of her people=E2=80=94the Igorots, indigen=
ous people of Northern Luzon in the West Philippine Sea. They have managed =
to retain their culture despite three hundred years of colonizing attempts =
by the Spanish, Japanese, and Americans. As we've worked on essays together=
, I've come to realize that the Igorots (like so many other kincentric cult=
ures) retain a dazzlingly different view of the world than modern cultures.

Working with her on refining paragraphs and sentences, I=E2=80=99ve become =
particularly conscious of the problematic modern words in my own English vo=
cabulary.

Perhaps the most egregious is the way many of us write the name of our home=
 planet: Earth.

Specifically, the third rock from the Sun.

Specificity is key here. The word =E2=80=9Cearth=E2=80=9D has several disam=
biguations. For example, when we refer to soil or the ground=E2=80=94or eve=
n tectonic plates=E2=80=94we speak of "the earth". For example, "the earth =
beneath my feet." Notice the article and the lack of capitalization. Here, =
the sentence is not referring to our planet but rather an aspect of its sur=
face. This use of the word earth is not an issue.

Writing of our planet Earth, however, is another matter.

Alas, all too often, well-intentioned environmentalists and Earth-lovers re=
fer to "the Earth" when they are talking about the planet.

For example, Bill Gates writes: "The earth is warming, it=E2=80=99s warming=
 because of human activity, and the impact is bad and will get much worse" =
(2015, How to Solve a Climate Crisis).

Another example: =E2=80=9CReconnecting with the Earth and each other=E2=80=
=9D (Bioneers slogan).

Or: "We would seek to preserve the sanctity of life and replenish the Earth=
=E2=80=99s natural systems..." (Daniel Pinchbeck, Foundation).

First, let's be clear, these are all categorical stylistic mistakes.

The AP Stylebook [https://earthen.io/r/395d6d0b?m=3D4dbbb711-73e9-4fd0-9056=
-a7cc1af6a905] and the MLA guide [https://earthen.io/r/c3f5759c?m=3D4dbbb71=
1-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a905] stand against the use of the article the whe=
n referring to the planet Earth (though slightly lukewarm in their emphasis=
*). However, the UN style guide [https://earthen.io/r/c490a7c8?m=3D4dbbb711=
-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a905], and the American Astronomical Society, Space=
=2Ecom [https://earthen.io/r/74258bba?=
m=3D4dbbb711-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a90=
5] are clear. They instruct capitalization. The NASA's style guide [https:/=
/earthen.io/r/6a107103?m=3D4dbbb711-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a905] states"[we=
] capitalize the first letter in Earth, Moon, and Sun. In addition, do not =
use the modified =E2=80=98the=E2=80=99 before Earth").

So, if you write =E2=80=9Cthe Earth=E2=80=9D for the planet, you are alread=
y swimming against the current of established English language conventions.

But this isn't just about style=C2=B2. This is ontological. The way we writ=
e 'Earth' betrays and perpetuates a deep corruption of thought with dire ec=
ological consequences.

Think for a moment about how we talk about the other planets in our solar s=
ystem.

Do you say, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d love to visit the Mars=E2=80=9D?

Or, =E2=80=9CLooks like the Jupiter=E2=80=99s red spot is acting up today=
=E2=80=9D?

Or, =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s try to avoid the atmospheric fate of the Venus=
=E2=80=9D?

Of course not.

We intuitively recognize Mars, Jupiter, Venus as proper names. Names that b=
elong to entities, not objects. We don=E2=80=99t put an article in front of=
 them because the turns a be-ing into a some-thing.

After all, the planets are named after the great gods of antiquity for a re=
ason. As celestial companions to humanity for countless millennia, these be=
acons of light in the sky are filled with mystery and majesty. Even today, =
as per the International Astronomical Union=E2=80=99s naming conventions, n=
ewly discovered planets and moons must be named after gods from one of huma=
nity=E2=80=99s religions. As we send probes to planets to learn more about =
their unique combinations of matter, orbital positions, and chemistries, we=
 increasingly appreciate that each planet has a cosmological character all =
its own.

Earth is of course one of these planets.

And yet, over the last two millennia, our view and naming of our home world=
 has become corrupted.

One can trace it back to ancient Greek and Roman axioms that put humans on =
a pedestal. Over time, their glorification of human gods and heroes evolved=
 into an understanding of the world in the which humans were special, separ=
ate and central to everything else. This current of anthropocentricism even=
tually culminated in the Scientific Revolution=E2=80=99s materialist worldv=
iew. Grounded in Cartesian dualism, matter and mind, humanity and nature [h=
ttps://earthen.io/r/b9260512?m=3D4dbbb711-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a905], wer=
e split apart. The physical world=E2=80=94res extensa=E2=80=94was to be stu=
died, measured, and mastered, while mind and spirit were relegated to the a=
bstract.

From this divide, Earth came to be seen not as a living being or a sacred e=
ntity, but as an inert object. The shift was subtle yet profound: Earth was=
 no longer an entity we lived with, but what we lived on.

Modern ideologies, whether capitalist or socialist, feminist or fascist, in=
herited this foundational view of Earth as a passive provider. Rather than =
seeing mountains, rivers, trees, animals=E2=80=94each with majesty and char=
acter all their own=E2=80=94the modern gaze came to see them more and more =
as objects: Forests became timber, mountains became mines, rivers became wa=
ter supplies.

Numerous words we use today reflects this thinking=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cthe Ear=
th,=E2=80=9D, "nature", =E2=80=9Cnatural resources,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cthe e=
nvironment=E2=80=9D (all terms that are missing in the Igorot language [htt=
ps://earthen.io/r/6e99c03b?m=3D4dbbb711-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a905]). This=
 linguistic objectification enabled, and indeed justified, the expansion of=
 extractive economies and colonial dominion. The English language has come =
to quite literally 'articulate' the world around us: to divide it into inan=
imate objects that are separate and self-less.

In sharp contrast, kincentric cultures such as the Igorots refer to plants,=
 animals, mountains, and rivers as entities=E2=80=94without qualifying arti=
cles. Kincentric languages carry a built-in reverence for those with whom t=
hey share space. You do not say the Grandmother when you call her by name; =
you simply say her name. Likewise, a mountain, a river, a forest is address=
ed as someone, not something.

Learning from them, we must revisit not only our actions but our assumption=
s=E2=80=93 the integral transition of our age. And that begins with how we =
write and how we name the unique cosmological entity that is our common hom=
e.

Perhaps the measure of how important this transition is can be seen in how =
difficult it is to make.

In my own writing, I=E2=80=99ve been striving to excise =E2=80=9Cthe=E2=80=
=9D from Earth for the last year! Despite reflecting on the importance of t=
his change, developing an ethical theory around it, and writing this very e=
ssay, I constantly find myself correcting my inadvertent Earth objectificat=
ions.

I am sure you will too.

All the more reason to be gentle with those who make the mistake. The deepl=
y ingrained tendency to write this way points to just how embedded the obje=
ctification of Earth is in our modern way of seeing the world.

However, there is no room for ambiguity.

Not only is the articulation and objectification of Earth stylistically fla=
wed, it belies an insidious misconception. For ancient and ongoing kincentr=
ic cultures the objectification of Earth and her entities is both absent in=
 their language and anathema in their ontology.

To move forward, we must first thoroughly excise our objectification of pla=
net Earth from our vocabulary. Only then can we shatter the mind-forged man=
acles of antiquated, materialist cosmology and open the door to the ecologi=
cal regeneration to which our moment so urgently calls.

Here is the door.

Once we remove =E2=80=9Cthe=E2=80=9D from =E2=80=9CEarth=E2=80=9D, it is th=
at much easier to remove it when we speak of Bear, of Salmon, of Eagle, of =
Whale, and whatever other kindred creatures share space with you. And once =
we do, their commodification, exploitation, and depletion become that much =
more difficult and inconceivable.

Furthermore, when we name Earth without an article, we name a presence rath=
er than an object. We honor a cosmological entity that has, for billions of=
 years, concentrated matter, dispersed energy, increased biodiversity, and =
raised awareness. And with that, we can we at last see Earth as a teacher=
=E2=80=94an example that we, as Earthlings, can and should follow [https://=
earthen.io/r/0c4e2d1d?m=3D4dbbb711-73e9-4fd0-9056-a7cc1af6a905].

Only then, as our language re-aligns and harmonizes with ecological and ont=
ological reality, so too can we.

It is synchronization that must begin at the root=E2=80=93 with our words. =
In this small but sovereign act of re-naming, our sentences change, our sto=
ries change, and with them, our cities and our world.

flecting on this kind of woe and where it comes from. We&#39;ve been workin=
g hard on plastic pollution from the perspective of her people&#x2014;the I=
gorots, indigenous people of Northern Luzon in the West Philippine Sea. The=
y have managed to retain their culture despite three hundred years of colon=
izing attempts by the Spanish, Japanese, and Americans. As we&#39;ve worked=
 on essays together, I&#39;ve come to realize that the Igorots (like so man=

l disambiguations. For example, when we refer to soil or the ground&#x2014;=
or even tectonic plates&#x2014;we speak of &quot;the earth&quot;. For examp=
le, &quot;the earth beneath my feet.&quot; Notice the article and the lack =
of capitalization. Here, the sentence is not referring to our planet but ra=
ther an aspect of its surface. This use of the word <em>earth</em> is not a=
n issue.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em; color: #15=

 a reason. As celestial companions to humanity for countless millennia, the=

day, as per the International Astronomical Union&#x2019;s naming convention=

humanity&#x2019;s religions. As we send probes to planets to learn more abo=

 we increasingly appreciate that each planet has a cosmological character a=

an trace it back to ancient Greek and Roman axioms that put humans on a ped=
estal. Over time, their glorification of human gods and heroes evolved into=
 an understanding of the world in the which humans were special, separate a=
nd central to everything else. This current of anthropocentricism eventuall=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em; color: #15212A;">From this di=

of Earth as a passive provider. Rather than seeing mountains, rivers, trees=

lor: #15212A;">In sharp contrast, kincentric cultures such as the Igorots r=
efer to plants, animals, mountains, and rivers as entities&#x2014;without q=
ualifying articles. Kincentric languages carry a built-in reverence for tho=
se with whom they share space. You do not say <em>the Grandmother</em> when=
 you call her by name; you simply say her name. Likewise, a mountain, a riv=
er, a forest is addressed as someone, not something.</p><p style=3D"margin:=

ust revisit not only our actions but our assumptions&#x2013; the integral t=

 unique cosmological entity that is our common home.</p><p style=3D"margin:=

n my own writing, I&#x2019;ve been striving to excise &#x201C;the&#x201D; f=

of this change, developing an ethical theory around it, and writing this ve=

culation and objectification of Earth stylistically flawed, it belies an in=
sidious misconception. For ancient and ongoing kincentric cultures the obje=
ctification of Earth and her entities is both absent in their language and =
anathema in their ontology.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height=
: 1.6em; color: #15212A;">To move forward, we must first thoroughly excise =
our objectification of planet Earth from our vocabulary. Only then can we s=
hatter the mind-forged manacles of antiquated, materialist cosmology and op=
en the door to the ecological regeneration to which our moment so urgently =
calls.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em; color: #1521=

em; color: #15212A;">Once we remove &#x201C;the&#x201D; from &#x201C;Earth&=
#x201D;, it is that much easier to remove it when we speak of Bear, of Salm=
on, of Eagle, of Whale, and whatever other kindred creatures share space wi=
th you. And once we do, their commodification, exploitation, and depletion =
become that much more difficult and inconceivable.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em; color: #15212A;">Furthermore, when we name =
Earth without an article, we name a presence rather than an object. We hono=
r a cosmological entity that has, for billions of years, concentrated matte=
r, dispersed energy, increased biodiversity, and raised awareness.  And wit=
h that, we can we at last see Earth as a teacher&#x2014;an example that we,=
