# gobrik 3

GoBrik is the ecological action platform developed and maintained by the Global Ecobrick Alliance.  This is the third version of our app that manifests our complete transition from the knack.com database platform to our own self hosted mysql database.  GoBrik 3.0 integrates seemlessly with ecobricks.org and our Bhuwana user credential login system.  GoBrik 3.1 is the relaunch of the repository to clean out accidently published API keys and to reorgaize our server directory structure.
